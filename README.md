<h3><u>Fitness Tracker<u></h3>

<h3>Description:</h3>
    "Fitness Tracker" is a Node.js application, deployed through Heroku, that allows the user to 1) log daily workouts with cardio and resistance exercises; 2) view a dashboard of overall stats (excercise duration and overall weight).  When the application opens, the user has two options from the homepage: "Create New Workout" or "Continue Current Workout".  In either option, the user will be directed to enter resistence and cardio exercises, the number of sets, reps, and overall time. When the user chooses "Add Exercise" the exercise will be added to the current workout.  When the user chooses "Complete" then the current workout will be completed and the data from all exercises aggregated. In the opper left corner, the user can toggle between Fitness Tracker (the page for entering workout data) and Dashboard (the page for aggregating total workout information from workouts).
